# SentimentAnalysis
Used Word2Vec to convert sentences to vectors, also used positional vectors for capturing context of the sentences. Then this vectors were padded to form
a uniform length array which were in turn feeded into neural networks, as neural networks can't be feeded with variable size array's. These vectors were 
feeded into a Artificial Neural Network, which also got the four labels of sentiments to be trained upon.
